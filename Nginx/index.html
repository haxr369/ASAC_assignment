        <p class="intro">Earth's rotation period relative to the Sun—its mean solar day—is 86,400 seconds of mean solar time (86,400.0025 SI seconds). Because Earth's solar day is now <em>slightly</em> longer than it was during the 19th century due to tidal deceleration, <strong>day varies between 0 and 2 SI ms longer.</strong></p>
